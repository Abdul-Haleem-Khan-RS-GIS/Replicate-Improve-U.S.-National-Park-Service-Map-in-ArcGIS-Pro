# Replicate-Improve-U.S.-National-Park-Service-Map-in-ArcGIS-Pro
I worked on enhancing the cartographic design of National Park Service (NPS) maps, focusing on refining color schemes, symbology, and labeling to improve readability and usability. My goal was to create clearer, more user-friendly maps that serve both park visitors and officials, ensuring better navigation and understanding of park features.

By carefully selecting harmonized color palettes, intuitive symbols, and legible labels, I optimized the visual hierarchy, making key features stand out while maintaining a clean, balanced design. These improvements help visitors easily interpret trail networks, landmarks, facilities, and park boundaries, while also providing officials with accurate and efficient cartographic resources for management and planning.

My contributions align with the next generation of NPS maps, making them more accessible, visually appealing, and effective for a diverse audience. This redesign ultimately enhances the user experience, promoting better engagement with natural and cultural resources while ensuring functionality, accuracy, and aesthetic quality in park mapping.
